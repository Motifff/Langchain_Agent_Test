I'm thrilled to introduce our groundbreaking project, which harnesses the potential of large language models (LLMs) to facilitate sophisticated design process simulations, a realm that until recently, remained largely uncharted.

Our project centers around a meticulously designed virtual conference, where multi-stakeholder discussions take center stage. Each participant in this digital roundtable is imbued with distinct identities, psychological profiles, personalities, and knowledge backgrounds, thereby creating a microcosm that mirrors the complexity and diversity of real-life interactions. Given a topic, these digital agents engage in discourse, exercising their unique attributes to contribute perspectives that are as varied as they are insightful.

The dialogue evolves through iterative cycles, with each round culminating in a vote that steers the direction of subsequent discussions. This dynamic feedback loop, informed by both the agents' inputs and the collective decision-making process, pushes the boundaries of traditional debate structures, enabling the exploration of nuanced social dynamics and economic theories that are otherwise impractical to test in reality.

To elevate the immersive nature of this experience, we've integrated our LLM within a custom-designed Unity environment. This interactive space goes beyond a mere conversational interface, offering a transparent view into the decision-making logic and dialogue progression of the agents. Participants' statements and the evolving topics across rounds are meticulously documented, fostering an environment where every exchange contributes to a rich tapestry of ideas.

Recognizing the limitations inherent in linear, sequential presentations, we've introduced an innovative visualization tool inspired by Google's Embedding Projector. By leveraging LLM-generated embeddings, we map the intricate web of ideas and their interconnections in three-dimensional space. This visual representation not only alleviates the need for exhaustive textual analysis but also grants immediate insight into the relationships between each agent's proposals and the overarching themes, enabling swift comprehension and strategic decision-making.

Moreover, this visual interface uncovers patterns and potential inconsistencies in the LLM's output, allowing observers to detect any deviations or self-referential loops that may emerge during the generation process. Such transparency is pivotal in maintaining the credibility and utility of our simulations.

An intriguing observation we've made pertains to the influence of the virtual environment itselfâ€”specifically, the roundtable setting. It has inadvertently steered the direction of conversations and decision-making, highlighting the subtle yet significant impact of context on artificial intelligence behavior. This serendipitous finding underscores another layer of complexity we're keen to delve into further.

In summary, our project pioneers a new frontier in simulating human behavior within design practices, leveraging the power of LLMs to create dynamic, interactive environments that not only test theories but also enhance our understanding of group dynamics and decision-making processes. As we continue to refine this platform, we eagerly anticipate the insights it will yield, shaping the future of social simulations and offering unprecedented tools for researchers and practitioners alike. Thank you for your attention, and we look forward to sharing more about our ongoing discoveries.
